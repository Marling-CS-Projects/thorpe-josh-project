### Objectives

In this cycle, I will. My objectives in this cycle are:

* [ ] Balance the weapons, enemies, bosses and levels accordingly so that the game feels fun and fair
* [ ] Ensure that no enemies spawn too close to the player

  * [ ] Go to the next level by pressing r
  * [ ] Add a coin by pressing m
