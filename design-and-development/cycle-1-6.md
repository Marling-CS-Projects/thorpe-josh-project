# 2.2.6 Cycle 6 - Basic Enemies

## Design

### Objectives

My objective in this cycle is to focus on creating basic enemies. In this cycle I plan to:

* [x] Add enemies to the level generation so that they can appear in levels
* [x] Enemies will move toward the player
* [ ] After a random amount of time each enemy will stop to shoot then move again
* [ ] Enemies have set health and will take damage upon collision with bullets
* [ ] Enemies die after all health is lost

### Usability Features

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                   |

| foo           | does something useful |

### Pseudocode

```
procedure do_something
    
end procedure
```

## Development

### Outcome

put code here

```
// Some code
```

explain

```
// Some code
```

### Challenges

I am facing challenges with 'After a random amount of time each enemy will stop to shoot then move again'.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions  | What I expect     | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code      | Thing happens     | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Press buttons | Something happens | As expected           | Pass      |
