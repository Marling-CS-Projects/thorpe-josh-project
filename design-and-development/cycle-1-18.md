# 2.2.17 Cycle 17 - More Smaller Features \[IN PROGRESS]

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle, I aim to add a pause feature, an effect when the player takes damage, and a background for the HUD elements. My objectives in this cycle are to:

* [x] Add pause menu with escape key
* [x] Update how to play menu with pause info
* [x] Small screen shake when taking damage
* [x] Red screen effect when taking damage
* [x] Add HUD background for sides around the level itself
* [x] Change level background colour to fit better

#### Smaller Features

* [ ] Fix boss healthbar ending early
* [x] Add a new door sprite
* [ ] Add notch lines to the boss health bar
* [x] When starting a new game after death, reset the weapon to gear gun
* [x] Fix the health potion deducting 4 coins instead of 5
* [x] Reduce spikes in boss levels
