# 2.2.7 Cycle 7 - Improved Level System

## Design

### Objectives

My objective in this cycle is to alter the level system within the game so that:

* [ ] Each floor starts with a shop room (empty for now)
* [ ] 5 random levels are chosen from the possibleLevels array and these are played next
* [ ] A floor ends with a boss room (empty for now)

### Usability Features

| Variable Name | Use                   |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| foo           | does something useful |

### Pseudocode

```
procedure do_something
    
end procedure
```

## Development

### Outcome

put code here

```
// Some code
```

explain

```
// Some code
```

### Challenges

I am facing a challenge with my code where it causes an 'Aww snap error" with the webpage.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions  | What I expect     | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
