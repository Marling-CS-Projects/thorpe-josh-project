### Objectives

In this cycle, I will. My objectives in this cycle are:

* [ ] Move around all the elements of the HUD so that it fits better
* [ ] Add a proper win screen
* [ ] Add a proper end screen
* [x] Make main menu buttons and text bigger
* [x] Add character descriptions in character selection
* [ ] Move shopkeeper messages to the bottom of the screen
* [x] Add menu titles to the main menu (including a name for the game)
* [x] Add a background colour to the main menu

#### Smaller Changes

* [x] Add sprites for Sir Galahad and Deadeye Dave
* [x] Ensure that the player is the correct size to fit between boxes in the game
