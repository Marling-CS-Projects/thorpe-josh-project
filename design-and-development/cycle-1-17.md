# 2.2.16 Cycle 16 - Smaller Features and Error Prevention \[UPCOMING]

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle, I will make some changes to improve the weapon system. My objectives in this cycle are to:

* [ ] &#x20;Change the player bullets to rectangles, and make the shotgun fire small pellets
* [ ] Make the machine pistol and brass spraygun automatic weapons (you can hold down click to shoot them)

Currently, my game is missing a few checks which can cause it to break.

* [ ] Starting the game without selecting a character throws an error
* [ ] Dashing into the next level does not reset the speed
* [ ] Players can purchase weapons which they already own, which get put in the inventory twice

#### Smaller Changes

* [ ] Add new sprites for the walls, spikes, boxes and doors
* [ ] Further reduce the number of spikes and boxes in levels (there are still too many, which is annoying
* [ ] Adjust some of the enemy spawn locations in levels so that they are not too close to the player
* [ ] Rename Ironclad Carbine to Ironclad Rifle (easier name for players to understand)
