# 2.2.16 Cycle 16 - Smaller Features and Error Prevention \[IN PROGRESS]

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle, I will make some smaller changes and fixes. First, I would like to:

* [x] &#x20;Change the player bullets to rectangles, except for  the shotgun which fires small pellets
* [x] Enemies and bosses fire red rectangles
* [ ] Make the machine pistol and brass spraygun automatic weapons (you can hold down click to shoot them)

I would also like to add a boss healthbar to display how much of a boss's health is left.

* [ ] Add boss healthbar to boss fights

Currently, my game is missing a few checks which can cause it to break or cause bugs. In this cycle, I will fix those.

* [ ] Starting the game without selecting a character throws an error
* [ ] Dashing into the next level does not reset the speed
* [ ] Players can purchase weapons which they already own, which get put in the inventory twice
* [ ] Purchasing items will deduct one less coin than required

#### Smaller Changes

* [ ] Add new sprites for the walls, spikes, boxes and doors
* [ ] Further reduce the number of spikes and boxes in levels (there are still too many, which is annoying
* [ ] Adjust some of the enemy spawn locations in levels so that they are not too close to the player
* [x] Rename Ironclad Carbine to Ironclad Rifle (easier name for players to understand)
