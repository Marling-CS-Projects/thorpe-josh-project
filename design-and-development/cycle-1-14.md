# 2.2.13 Cycle 13 - Shop & More Weapons

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle, I plan to add the shop feature. My objectives in this cycle are to:

* [x] Make the shopkeeper unmoveable when you walk into him
* [x] Add 2 new weapons (Clockwork Revolver and Ironclad Carbine)
* [x] Touching the shopkeeper at a shop level will display a message that says the prices for each item
* [x] Each item can be bought with each key if the player has enough coins to meet the price
* [x] All the locked weapons are in the shop
* [x] Add healing potion in the shop
* [x] Add doors to shop and boss fight levels
* [x] Change the first shop level to an introduction level which displays a starting message when touching the shopkeeper

#### Smaller Changes

* [x] Fix the health bar bug with it not updating correctly
* [x] Add new sprites for enemies 4, 5, and 6
* [ ] Add sprites for each playable character
* [ ] Add new sprites for walls, boxes, spikes, and doors
