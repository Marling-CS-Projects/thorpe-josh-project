# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

The following criteria from my [1.5 Sucess Criteria](../analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md) relate to the function and robustness of my game.

| Criterion | Description                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 34        | The game should be stable and not buggy. It should perform normally even under unexpected user inputs. |
| 35        | The program should run smoothly without freezing or stuttering.                                        |
| 36        | The game should run at a minimum of 30 frames per second.                                              |

### Criterion 34

> The game should be stable and not buggy. It should perform normally even under unexpected user inputs.

I tried everything I could to try to break or crash my game. This involved unexpected or borderline inputs, like trying to start the game without starting a character or trying to buy the same weapon more than once by spam-clicking in a short duration. My game remained stable and had no issues so this criterion was passed.

### Criterion 35

> The program should run smoothly without freezing or stuttering.

Having played the game for an extended period of time, I think that it is safe to conclude that the program runs smoothly because no freezing or crashing occurred throughout my testing. Therefore I consider this criterion to be passed.

### Criterion 36

> The game should run at a minimum of 30 frames per second.

Kaboom has an inbuilt frames per second (fps) tool which displays the current fps of the game in the top left of the screen.
