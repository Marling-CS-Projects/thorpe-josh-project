# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

The following criteria from my [1.5 Sucess Criteria](../analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md) relate to the function and robustness of my game.

| Criterion | Description                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 34        | The game should be stable and not buggy. It should perform normally even under unexpected user inputs. |
| 35        | The program should run smoothly without freezing or crashing.                                          |
| 36        | The game should run at a minimum of 30 frames per second.                                              |
