| Test               | Test Details                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Is the objective of the game clear?                                                      |
| 2 - Efficient      | <p>Are the controls easy to use?<br>Is the menu and character selection easy to use?</p> |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is the game fun to play?                                                                 |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | <p>Does the game lag?<br>Have you encountered any bugs?</p>                              |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Does the how-to-play menu make it easy to learn the controls?                            |

To gather responses to these questions, I sent my game to friends and family and asked them to complete a survey after playing. Listed below are the results of the questions I asked. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation.
