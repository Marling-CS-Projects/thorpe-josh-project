To gather responses to these questions, I sent my game to friends and family and asked them to complete a survey after playing. Listed below are the results of the questions I asked and I will go over the results in greater depth during my project evaluation.

Overall, I received 18 responses to my form.

### User Feedback

#### 1 -Effective

100% of respondents answered that the objective of the game is clear, which is great. It's a fundamental necessity for players to know what to do and the fact that everyone knew what to do helped them jump right into playing the game. The success of this question is likely due to in part the introduction level at the start of the game which introduces an element of lore and a brief note on what to do.

#### 2 - Efficient

All respondents found the menus either very easy (94.4%) or easy (5.6%) to navigate. This means that it was easy for players to jump right into playing, or start a new game. It also shows that the menus were well-designed and easy to use.

#### 3 - Engaging

22.2% of respondents said the game was 'fun' and the remaining 77.8% said the game was 'very fun'. It is great to see that everyone enjoyed my game so much and that I have made an engaging and entertaining game.

#### 4 - Error Tolerant

All respondents either said that there was no lag at all (77.8%) or a small amount of lag (22.2%). This is great to see since it means that my game is not too computationally demanding or resource-intensive. Therefore it is possible to play it on lower-end computers, which increases the audience who can play my game.

<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Wk4YA78xIeNI3u59rBe_tt6DdAJ4AhjkrPSxS_bphwDr1MebHQ1QSQhL8WonvrhA_9xJVtRx-t9xURXMXa-T4Dv4712OWXkkfo0vMDvVpd3zKvPQQLSyI3icPZq44q52stKe3NZyN8nmrnbkZmbzwD4" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The majority of players (83.3%) encountered no bugs at all which is great as it suggests that my game is largely bug-free. Of the 16.7% of responses that said they experienced at least one bug, most of the errors reported involved issues with window sizing on very small laptop screens.

One user wrote: "_I found the screen size wasn't quite right - half of the game seemed to overlap off the screen._" The way to fix this is by reducing the scale in your browser to zoom it out until everything fits in, perhaps at 75% zoom for example. Because a noticeable amount of players experienced this, a way to fix this would perhaps be to implement a pop-up in-game if your window size is too small which says to zoom out your browser.

#### 5 - Easy to Learn

100% of respondents found that the how to play menu makes the controls clear. This shows that I designed the menu well and it lets players quickly learn the controls and jump right into playing my game.

<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mlJM5MIX0l-2ne3_Owl58LSiqXW19y2CVf5qlQfHeTF0ctBfYC80EqzqCqmnkTnOiNFpe-i59qZ3m3kVR1yCmJgPTDvFQ8PMLFylGhQdW1HtKnUn237lL8yC_WSxeJOZEyFg92MT1Uz5z0wQl2HXcJk" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The vast majority of respondents found that the controls were either very easy (66.7%) or easy (27.8%) to learn. Only one respondent said that the controls were neither easy nor difficult to learn. Overall, this suggests that the controls for my game were easy to pick up after a bit of play, which allows players to enjoy the game instead of focusing on how to play. Also, having a good grasp of the controls allows players to progress further into the game, for example when they start dodging projectiles by dashing.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 32        | The game should provide a challenge without being unfair. |
| 33        | The game should meet the PEGI 12 guidelines.              |

### Criterion 32

> The game should provide a challenge without being unfair.

<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/j5eX-bHXHRJRdbwTS2eYu2zChmuxnmHIflEjcVDD2twf8eR1dTmxUtZPos0Go5D2XeEpsOrrfSWsIuZXvG_JMbtaRWvYg2A3OKpPlR2tJXasRu0LrA2KGRbWwpBdBfLaQ5XlvSx2qKQZWAkZsOGNRf4" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The majority of respondents (53.8%) thought that the balance of the game was just right, a significant proportion of respondents (38.5%) thought that it was a bit too hard, and a small proportion (7.7%) thought that it was a bit too easy. This suggests that I could make the game slightly easier and players weighed it up more to the harder side.

### Criterion 33

> The game should meet the PEGI 12 guidelines.

<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/o_S3eA3KCfatQ3lRsgogE1dAws76Cl4_gRt5nY17slLwLzZ15gAbJjxCaiOVhfH4szcM7hbAmFP2H7du4np9bx0gqCCfDNqLhbqTBRnk-KSE4M3cgJ5_d6WKK5mDBD8a-pRi6uNsprZ0mHq4Yl5iCns" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

100% of respondents agreed that my game meets the requirements for a PEGI 12 rating. The violence in my game is mild and there are no graphic language or scenes.
