# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

The development requirements are the specifications necessary to create a game.

To develop my game I will be using Kaboom.js. Kaboom.js does not require a great computer and can be used on low-end computers. Therefore I will only need a browser to use it. [https://gamedevacademy.org/kaboom-js-tutorials/#Fast\_and\_lightweight](https://gamedevacademy.org/kaboom-js-tutorials/#Fast\_and\_lightweight) I will be using Google Chrome because I regularly use this search engine and already have it installed.

| Software    | Hardware Required                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Web browser | <ul><li>Proc</li><li>RAM</li><li>Disk Space</li></ul> |
