| 3        | The weapon points in the direction of the mouse cursor and clicking will shoot/swing in that direction.                 | This system is intuative and makes combat easy.                                          |           |
| 4        | When near a chest or purchasable item, pressing E will carry out the action.                                            | E is near the movement keys which makes it easier to interact with objects while moving. |           |
| 5        | The keys 1,2 and 3 can be used to switch weapon being used if up to 3 weapons are owned.                                | Being able to use multiple weapons makes the game feel more diverse and exciting.        |           |
