## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Thinking abstractly involves devising a model that represents reality and removing details that are not relevant to the problem at hand. By visualizing abstract concepts, they can become more concrete and easier to grasp. Furthermore, abstraction reduces complexity, improves efficiency, and promotes code reusability.

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead involves planning inputs and outputs, determining pre-conditions for solving a problem and considering the need for reusable program components.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Thinking procedurally simplifies programming by breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts: a technique known as decomposition. This approach makes it simpler to understand and design the smaller subproblems, resulting in a more efficient program. Through decomposition, a large and complicated problem can be continuously broken down into smaller subproblems that are simpler to solve.

## Thinking Logically

Logical thinking involves analysing a situation or problem and coming up with potential solutions. It also involves recognising where the user needs to make decisions within the program and mapping out the potential consequences of those decisions.

## Thinking Concurrently

Concurrent thinking refers to the ability to accomplish multiple tasks simultaneously, but it doesn't necessarily imply that you have to work on several tasks at the same time.
