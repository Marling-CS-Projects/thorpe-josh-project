# 1.4b Computational Methods

Following the computational methods allow you to create an efficient and useful solution and helps your project remain easy to understand even when it gets quite big. I will use computational methods in my game to make development easier and improve the player's experience.

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Thinking abstractly involves devising a model that represents reality and removing details that are not relevant to the problem at hand. By visualizing abstract concepts, they can become more concrete and easier to grasp. Furthermore, abstraction reduces complexity, improves efficiency, and promotes code reusability.

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead involves planning inputs and outputs, determining pre-conditions for solving a problem and considering the need for reusable program components.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Thinking procedurally simplifies programming by breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts: a technique known as decomposition. This approach makes it simpler to understand and design the smaller subproblems, resulting in a more efficient program. Through decomposition, a large and complicated problem can be continuously broken down into smaller subproblems that are simpler to solve.

## Thinking Logically

Logical thinking involves analysing a situation or problem and developing potential solutions. It also involves recognising where the user needs to make decisions within the program and mapping out the potential consequences of those decisions.

There will be many choices that the player can make in my game, so it needs to respond logically to whatever the player decides to do.

* The player may choose to buy items or powerups from the shop so the game must respond accordingly by giving the player what they bought.
* Players can choose which weapon they use so my game needs to make sure that the gun's skin and mechanics are correct.
* The game should be constantly checking for if any controls have been pressed while ignoring any invalid key presses.

## Thinking Concurrently

Concurrent thinking refers to the ability to accomplish multiple tasks simultaneously, but it doesn't necessarily imply that you have to work on several tasks simultaneously.

* Sound effects need to coincide with in-game actions for example when an enemy is killed a sound effect should be played.
* Every time the player kills an enemy or collects a coin the game needs to keep track of it so that it can be displayed at the end of the dungeon along with other relevant statistics.
* Multiple enemies will be present in the same room therefore it is important for the movement of each enemy to be operated concurrently.
