### Overview

_Enter the Gungeon_ is a bullet hell roguelike game developed by Dodge Roll. In the game players take on the role of one of several characters called Gungeoneers, each with their own unique abilities and starting weapons. Players explore a procedurally generated dungeon known as the Gungeon with the goal of finding a powerful gun that can "_kill the past_". The Gungeon is filled with a variety of enemies which players must use their weapons to defeat while dodging many enemy projectiles coming their way.  If the player dies, they lose all items and guns obtained on a playthrough and must start again at the first floor.

### Controls

Enter the Gungeon uses WASD movement.

## Soul Knight

### Overview

_Soul Knight_ is a top-down rougelike dungeon crawler developed by ChillyRoom where the ultimate goal is to reach the end of the dungeon. Players achieve this by using weapons which can be found or bought throughout the dungeon to deafeat enemies in each room and eventually bosses too. Players start off with a character of their choice and collect crafting materials and gems as they go which can be used in the lobby outside the dungeon to unlock new starting characters and starting weapons.

### Controls

Like most mobile games Soul Knight uses touchscreen controls. A joystick controls movement and there are various buttons to change weapon, fire the weapon and activate skills.

In Soul Knight the player's character automatically aims weapons towards the nearest enemy. This means that players have limited control over aiming but it makes the game simpler to learn and play.

| Feature            | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple art style   | A simple art style works well in Soul Knight and I think it will be effective in my game too. It helps players to easily distinguish important elements and will make it easier when there are lots o fprojectiles flying around. |
| Destructible cover | Destructible cover provides obstacles which players can hide behind but destroy to shoot through. It helps the game feel more immersive and forces the player to make decisions as to whether they want to destroy or use it.     |
| Chests             | In Soul Knight some rooms are special chest rooms where players can find new weapons somewhat frequently. I want to include something similar so that players do not get bored from using the same weapon for a long time.        |
| Melee weapons      | Melee weapons add diversity to Soul Knight and I would like to include them in mine to provide some contrast to using guns and make the game have a wider feel.                                                                   |

| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reviving     | By not introducing a revive system, dying feels more consequential as it causes the player to start over. Therefore the game will feel more exciting as the player may die at any moment.                                                                                                |
| Auto aim     | Being a mobile game, it makes sense for Soul Knight to simplify the aiming system in order to make the controls easier. However my game will be for PC so controls will not be an issue. I want players to aim for themselves as it will serve as a source of challenge within the game. |
| Skills       | In Soul Knight, each character has a unique skill which can be used with a cooldown. I am not going to include this because my game will not have that many characters and adding unique skills may be time consuming to implement, detracting from other aspects of the game.           |
| Mounts/mechs | Mounts and mechs allow the player to quickly move around the map to reach enemies quickly. This will not be necessary for my game because the map will be small enough so that the player will not have to travel far for each objective.                                                |
