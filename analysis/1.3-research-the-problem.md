# 1.3 Research

In this section, I have researched three different 'roguelike' games and analysed their features. The term roguelike refers to games that use specific mechanics modelled after the game _Rogue_, which became popular in the 1980s. Roguelike games typically feature hard-earned progression, procedural generation, and a high level of risk. [(Perry, 2023)](../5-references/reference-list.md#1.3-research) The games which I've researched are: _Enter the Gungeon_, _Soul Knight_ and _Spelunky 2_.

## Enter the Gungeon

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/enterthegungeongameplay.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

_Enter the Gungeon_ is a bullet hell roguelike shooter game developed by Dodge Roll. The term "b_ullet hell_" refers to a subgenre of shooters whose main gameplay focus is dodging seemingly endless waves of enemy projectiles. [(STANDS4 LLC, 2023)](../5-references/reference-list.md#1.3-research)

In the game, players take on the role of one of several characters called Gungeoneers, each with different starting weapons and unique statistics. Players explore a procedurally generated dungeon known as the Gungeon with the goal of finding a powerful gun that can "_kill the past_". The Gungeon is filled with a variety of enemies which attack in different patterns and deal different amounts of damage which is dealt to the player's character in the form of hearts. Players must use learn the attack patterns and use their weapons to defeat enemies while dodging many projectiles. New guns can be found in chests throughout the Gungeon or in the shop.

Bosses, which appear as the final challenge on each floor, are powerful enemies with high health, strong attacks and unpredictable attack patterns. They pose a great challenge for players to work to overcome. If the player dies, they lose all progress on a playthrough and must start again on the first floor. However, progress towards new characters or weapon unlocks is saved throughout runs. [(Messner, 2016)](../5-references/reference-list.md#1.3-research)

### Controls

_Enter the Gungeon_ uses the WASD movement system which is common in most PC games. Left click and right click are used to fire your weapon and dodge, while the mouse scroll wheel is used to switch between weapons. A series of other keys are used for various actions, for example interacting with 'E' or opening the inventory with 'I'. Overall, the keybinds and controls for _Enter the Gungeon_ are a little complex as there are many input options for the player to choose from. Newer players could find this a bit challenging but should be able to pick it up with a bit of practice. The table below lists the default controls but the keybinds can be changed in the settings menu.

| Permadeath                    | I will include permadeath in my game because it adds a sense of danger which makes the game feel more exciting. It also forces players to learn the mechanics and helps the game to still feel fun even when someone has played it for a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Bullet-hell aspects           | _Enter the Gungeon_ is a bullet hell roguelike game. I'd like to include this theme because dodging projectiles will be a key aspect of my game, leading to exciting gameplay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Different starting characters | Including different playable characters allows players to experiment with different playstyles or strategies and provides diversity to the game, giving players more to enjoy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| AI enemies                    | <p>Like in <em>Enter the Gungeon</em>, the enemies in my game will be controlled by an AI which will move towards and attack the player.</p><p></p><p>Enemies must behave somewhat predictably so players can learn to predict their movements and develop skills to become better at the game over time. Harder enemies will be stronger and more challenging to beat which gives a rewarding feeling to players as they manage to progress further each time.</p> |
| Unique weapons                | To keep each weapon interesting and enjoyable to use, it's essential to give them unique stats. Some weapons can also have special features like automatic firing or shotgun spread to set them apart and make them more fun for players.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 200+ weapons | I don't want to confuse the player by having an endless amount of different weapons. However, there needs to be enough distinct weapons to provide diversity and interest. Also, adding too many weapons to my game could take time away from developing other features.                                                                                           |
| Dodge roll   | In _Enter the Gungeon_ the dodge roll is used to dodge through enemy projectiles without taking damage and jump over crevices. In my game, I want to include a dash mechanic instead, which does not make the player impervious to incoming damage. The dash in my game will momentarily increase the player's movement speed to get out of a bad situation.       |
| Blanks       | In _Enter the Gungeon_, blanks are used to clear the entire area of gunfire for a moment and damage and push away enemies. This would not be appropriate for my game because there would not be as many projectiles on screen simultaneously. Therefore, I think this ability would be too powerful and make the game feel too easy, which would not be enjoyable. |

## Soul Knight

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/soulknightgameplay.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

_Soul Knight_ is a top-down dungeon crawler developed by ChillyRoom - a type of game in which the ultimate goal is navigating to the end of the dungeon. Players achieve this by using weapons which can be found or bought throughout the dungeon to defeat enemies in each room and bosses at the end of certain stages. Bosses are essentially strong enemies with high amounts of health and powerful attacks. Players begin the game with a character of their choosing. As they play through the dungeon, players can collect crafting materials and gems which can be used in the lobby to create new weapons and unlock new characters to play as. Each character has different statistics and a different ability which can be activated after cooldown. [(Koziara, 2017)](../5-references/reference-list.md#1.3-research)

### Controls

Like most mobile games _Soul Knight_ uses touchscreen controls. A joystick controls movement and there are various buttons to change the weapon being held, fire the weapon and activate the character's skill. The position of these buttons can be customised in the settings menu.

In _Soul Knight_ the player's character automatically aims weapons towards the nearest enemy. This means players have limited control over aiming, making the controls simpler to learn and play. [(Koziara, 2017)](../5-references/reference-list.md#1.3-research)

| Simple art style   | A simple art style is effective in _Soul Knight_, and I believe it will work well in my game too. It should offer players an aesthetically pleasing experience and make it simple for them to recognise key elements in the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Chests             | In _Soul Knight_, there are frequent special chest rooms where players can discover new weapons. I'd like to incorporate a similar feature to prevent players from getting tired of using the same weapon for an extended period. It would also add a sense of achievement or progression which should appeal to players.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Melee weapons      | Melee weapons add diversity to _Soul Knight_ and I would like to include them in my game to provide some contrast to using guns. Melee weapons force players to get up close and personal with the enemies, creating a more tense and exciting environment since players must carefully time their attacks to avoid getting hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Destructible cover | <p>Destructible cover refers to obstacles which players can hide behind to avoid enemies but it can be destroyed by attacking it.</p><p></p><p>I want to include destructible cover in my game because it adds more opportunity for players to develop their own strategies or techniques as to whether they want to hide behind it or shoot through it to attack enemies.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Exciting music     | _Soul Knight_ has an exciting soundtrack for the game (eg. [1](https://soundcloud.com/au2agdvwnt0x/soul-knight-ost-forests?in=user-427880486/sets/soul-knight-ost\&utm\_source=clipboard\&utm\_medium=text\&utm\_campaign=social\_sharing), [2](https://soundcloud.com/au2agdvwnt0x/soul-knight-ost-floor-1-boss?in=user-427880486/sets/soul-knight-ost\&utm\_source=clipboard\&utm\_medium=text\&utm\_campaign=social\_sharing)) which plays while fighting in the dungeon. Similarly, I want to include exciting music in my game which complements the gameplay and helps keep the player engaged. |

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reviving         | By not including a revive system, dying feels more consequential because death causes the game to start over. Therefore gameplay will feel more exciting because the player is aware of the consequences of dying, which could happen at any moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Auto aim         | <p>Being a mobile game, it makes sense for <em>Soul Knight</em> to simplify the aiming system in order to make the controls more accessible. However, the controls for my game will use a keyboard and mouse so there are plenty of possible inputs available.</p><p></p><p>I want players to aim weapons for themselves so that aiming serves as a source of challenge within the game. Players will be able to see their skills develop over time, which should feel rewarding.</p> |
| Character skills | In _Soul Knight_ each character has a unique skill which can be used with a cooldown. I won't be including this because my game will only have a few characters so statistics alone should be enough to differentiate them. Instead, all characters will have the dash ability as their skill. This will also mean I have more time to develop other features.                                                                                                                        |
| Mounts/mechs     | In _Soul Knight_, rideable creatures or robots allow the player to quickly move around the map to reach enemies quickly. This won't be needed in my game because the rooms will be smaller so the enemies will be closer together. This will make the gameplay more exciting and intense for players as there will be more action at once.                                                                                                                                            |

## Spelunky 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/spelunky2gameplay.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

_Spelunky 2_ is a 2D side-scrolling platformer game developed by Mossmouth and released in 2020. In the game, the player assumes control of a character called Ana, who must navigate through caves full of traps and enemies to reach treasures. If the player dies, they lose all their items and have to start the game again from the beginning. The layout is procedurally generated each time so that each playthrough feels unique and presents different challenges but players have a certain amount of control as they can choose their own path through the levels by going through different doors.

The shop in Spelunky 2 is where players can purchase boosts and equipment using game currency. Shopkeepers run these stores, and players must decide whether to buy items peacefully or try to steal and provoke their aggression.

Players start with a finite number of hitpoints however if they take too much damage or fall victim to traps or the ghost then they will die. The ghost appears after 3 minutes have passed in a level and chases the player until they either finish the level or die. To complete the game, players must win a final boss fight, or reach level 7-99 to get the secret ending. _Spelunky 2_ supports online multiplayer in both cooperative and competitive modes so you can play with friends or other players.

### Controls

_Spelunky 2_ is available on both PC and Xbox so there are different controls for keyboard and controller users. Overall the controls for _Spelunky 2_ are on the simpler side because there are fewer unique inputs the player has to contend with. _Spelunky 2_ benefits from this because it allows new players to pick up the game quickly and not feel overwhelmed. See the table below for a list default of controls. Keybinds can be changed in the settings menu for personalisation if required.

| Controls        | Keyboard   | Controller |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Movement        | Arrow keys | Left stick |
| Jump            | Z          | A          |
| Attack          | X          | X          |
| Bomb            | C          | B          |
| Rope            | D          | Y          |
| Use Door/Buy    | A          | RB         |
| Walk/Run (Hold) | LShift     | RT         |

#### Keyboard

The controls of _Spelunky 2_ are modelled around the ZX-Arrows control scheme that most 2D games use. The arrow keys are used for movement, while various other keys are used for different actions, for example, 'Z' is jump and 'X' is attack. The mouse serves little use in _Spelunky 2_, used only to navigate through menus.

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Boss fights | <p>A boss fight provides a momentary rise in intensity or a climax in a game which tests the player in some way or another. <a href="../5-references/reference-list.md#1.3-research">(Stout, 2010)</a></p><p></p><p>I'd like to include boss fights in my game to periodically challenge the player and provide measurable goals which players can use as milestones to work towards. </p><p></p><p>Beating boss fights should also give players a sense of achievement and satisfaction which will increase their desire to play more.</p> |
| Shop        | <p>In <em>Spelunky 2</em>, players will encounter shops which sell various items, weapons or services to the player. I want to include a shop in my game where players can buy new weapons and power-ups. </p><p></p><p>However, I don't want to include the stealing mechanic which <em>Spelunky 2</em> features because I don't want players to be frustrated if they get killed by the shopkeeper.</p>                                                                                                                                   |
| Traps       | <p>I want to include traps which can harm the player if they aren't careful. This will add another layer of danger to my game and hopefully keep players on their toes. </p><p></p><p>However, unlike in <em>Spelunky 2</em>, I don't want traps to instantly kill the player because again I think that it would be too unforgiving and frustrate players. </p><p></p><p><em>Spelunky 2</em> is known for being a very unforgiving game but I don't want players to stop playing if they die suddenly.</p>                                 |

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiplayer    | <p>I'm not including online multiplayer in my game because I think it would be too complicated for me to implement without sacrificing other elements of my game. </p><p></p><p>As for local multiplayer, it could be interesting but I don't think the controls would work properly since you would need two mice at once and the keyboard would be quite crowded with two players. </p><p></p><p>Despite not including multiplayer, my game will still be enjoyable without the social aspect which multiplayer brings since people can still play together and share how far they manage to get.</p> |
| Platforming    | I want the main focus of my game to be on defeating enemies and avoiding projectiles rather than jumping over spikes or obstacles, therefore the platforming aspect of _Spelunky 2_ doesn't fit with the vision I have for my game. I don't want to confuse the player by obscuring the core gameplay loop or making the objective of the game unclear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Fluid dynamics | <p><em>Spelunky 2</em> was highly praised for its realistic fluid dynamics. Realistic fluid dynamics can help a game feel more detailed and immersive but can be challenging to simulate in terms of processing power. <a href="../5-references/reference-list.md#1.3-research">(ZibraAI, 2021)</a></p><p></p><p>Designing a complex fluid dynamic system would be quite challenging, and may not be worth it for a feature that would only play a small part in my game. Furthermore, I'm unsure how fluid mechanics would be integrated into my game.</p>                                             |
| Ghost          | In _Spelunky 2_, the ghost encourages players to progress through the level as quickly as possible. While this can make the game more exciting, I want players to feel as though they can progress at their own pace and aren't penalised or pressured for taking their time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
