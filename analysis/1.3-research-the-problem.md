## Enter the Gungeon

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/enterthegungeongameplay.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

_Enter the Gungeon_ is a bullet hell roguelike game developed by Dodge Roll. In the game, players take on the role of one of several characters called Gungeoneers, each with their own unique abilities and starting weapons. Players explore a procedurally generated dungeon known as the Gungeon with the goal of finding a powerful gun that can "_kill the past_". The Gungeon is filled with a variety of enemies which players must use their weapons to defeat while dodging many enemy projectiles coming their way.  If the player dies, they lose all items and guns obtained on a playthrough and must start again on the first floor.

### Controls

Enter the Gungeon uses the WASD movement system which is common in most PC games. Left click and right click are used to fire and dodge while the mouse scroll wheel is used to switch between weapons. A series of other keys are used for various actions, for example interacting with 'E' or opening the inventory with 'I'. Overall, the keybinds and controls for Enter the Gungeon are a little complex which could be a bit confusing for newer players. The table below lists the default controls. The preset keybinds can be changed under the settings menu.

| Permadeath                    | I will include permadeath in my game because it adds a sense of danger which you don't otherwise have. It forces players to learn the mechanics and helps the game to still feel dangerous even to someone who has played it for a while.      |
| Bullet-hell aspects           | Enter the Gungeon is a bullet hell roguelike game. The term "_bullet hell_" refers to a subgenre of shooters whose main gameplay focus is dodging seemingly endless waves of coloured bullets. I'd like to include aspects of this in my game. |
| Different starting characters | Including different characters for players to play allows them to experiment with different playstyles and ultimately play how they like.                                                                                                      |
| AI enemies                    | Like Enter the Gungeon, the enemies in my game will be controlled by an AI which can move around and shoot at the player. It's important that they attack in somewhat predictable patterns so as to not frustrate the player.                  |
| Unique weapons                | It's important for each weapon to feel unique and different because this keeps the game exciting and engaging. In order to do this each weapon needs to have unique statistics and characteristics.                                            |

However, there need to be enough distinct weapons to provide diversity and interest.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Dodge roll   | In Enter the Gungeon the dodge roll is used to dodge through enemy projectiles without taking damage and jump over crevices. In my game, there will not be any holes in the ground and I want players to focus on avoiding projectiles rather than running through them. However, I do want to include a dash mechanic which does not make the player impervious to incoming fire. |
| Blanks       | In Enter the Gungeon, blanks are used to clear the entire area of gunfire for a moment and damage and push away enemies.  This would not be appropriate for my game because the enemies will not be strong enough to the point where this is necessary.                                                                                                                            |

## Soul Knight

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/soulknightgameplay.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

_Soul Knight_ is a top-down roguelike dungeon crawler developed by ChillyRoom where the ultimate goal is to reach the end of the dungeon. Players achieve this by using weapons which can be found or bought throughout the dungeon to defeat enemies in each room and eventually bosses too. Players start off with a character of their choice and collect crafting materials and gems as they go which can be used in the lobby outside the dungeon to unlock new starting characters and starting weapons.

### Controls

has various buttons to change the Like most mobile games Soul Knight uses touchscreen controls. A joystick controls movement and there are various buttons to change the weapon, fire the weapon and activate skills. The position of these buttons can be customised in the settings menu.

In Soul Knight the player's character automatically aims weapons towards the nearest enemy. This means that players have limited control over aiming, making the controls simpler to learn and play.

| Simple art style   | A simple art style works well in Soul Knight and I think it will be effective in my game too. It helps players to easily distinguish important elements and will make it easier when there are lots of projectiles flying around.     |
| Chests             | In Soul Knight some rooms are special chest rooms where players can find new weapons somewhat frequently. I want to include something similar so that players do not get bored from using the same weapon for a long time.            |
| Melee weapons      | Melee weapons add diversity to Soul Knight and I would like to include them in mine to provide some contrast to using guns and give the game a wider feel.                                                                            |
| Destructible cover | Destructible cover provides obstacles which players can hide behind but destroy to shoot through. It helps the game feel more immersive and forces the player to make decisions as to whether they want to destroy or use it.         |
| Exciting music     | Soul Knight has an exciting soundtrack for the game which plays while the player is fighting in the dungeon. Similarly, I want to include exciting music in my game which complements the gameplay and helps keep the player engaged. |

| Reviving     | By not introducing a revive system, dying feels more consequential as it causes the player to start over. Therefore the game will feel more exciting as the player may die at any moment.                                                                                                          |
| Auto aim     | Being a mobile game, it makes sense for Soul Knight to simplify the aiming system in order to make the controls more accessible. However, my game will be for PC so controls will not be an issue. I want players to aim for themselves as it will serve as a source of challenge within the game. |
| Skills       | In Soul Knight, each character has a unique skill which can be used with a cooldown. I will not include this because my game will not have that many characters and adding unique skills may be time-consuming to implement, detracting from other aspects of the game.                            |
| Mounts/mechs | Mounts and mechs allow the player to quickly move around the map to reach enemies quickly. This will not be necessary for my game because the map will be small enough so that the player will not have to travel far for each objective.                                                          |

## Spelunky 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/spelunky2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

_Spelunky 2_ is a 2D roguelike side-scrolling platformer game developed by Mossmouth and released in 2020. In the game, the player assumes control of a character called Ana, who must navigate through caves full of traps and enemies to reach treasures. If the player dies, they lose all their items and have to start the game again from the beginning. The layout is procedurally generated so that each playthrough feels unique and presents different challenges each time you play. The game also supports online multiplayer in both cooperative and competitive modes.

### Controls

Spelunky 2 is available on both PC and Xbox so there are different controls for keyboard and controller users. See the table below. Spelunky 2 benefits from having simple controls because it allows new players to pick up the game quickly and not feel overwhelmed with complexity.

| Controls        | Keyboard   | Controller |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Movement        | Arrow keys | Left stick |
| Jump            | Z          | A          |
| Attack          | X          | X          |
| Bomb            | C          | B          |
| Rope            | D          | Y          |
| Use Door/Buy    | A          | RB         |
| Walk/Run (Hold) | LShift     | RT         |

#### Keyboard

The controls of Spelunky 2 are modelled around the ZX-Arrows control scheme that most 2D games use. The arrow keys are used for movement, while various other keys are used for different actions, for example, 'Z' is jump and 'X' is attack. The mouse serves little use in Spelunky 2, used only to navigate through menus.&#x20;

#### Controller

Spelunky 2's control scheme is quite typical for an Xbox game. This means that players of other Xbox games can quickly learn to play and enjoy the game.

| Boss fights | Boss fights provide a momentary rise in intensity or a climax in a game which tests the player in some way or another. I'd like to include boss fights in my game to challenge the player and prevent the game from feeling repetitive.                                                       |
| Shop        | In Spelunky 2, players can find shops which sell various items, weapons or services to the player. I want to include a shop in my game where players can buy new weapons and power-ups. However, I don't want to include the stealing mechanic which Spelunky 2 features.                     |
| Traps       | I want to include traps which can harm the player if they are not too careful. This will add another layer of danger to my game and hopefully keep players on their toes. However, unlike in Spelunky 2, I don't want traps to instantly kill the player because it would be too unforgiving. |

| Fluid dynamics | Realistic fluid dynamics can help a game feel more detailed and immersive. However, they can be challenging to simulate in terms of processing power and the coding needed. I don't think the trouble is worth implementing a fluid system in my game.         |
| Ghost          | In Spelunky 2, the ghost encourages players to progress through the level as quickly as possible. While this can make the game more exciting, I want players to feel as though they can progress at their own pace and not be penalised for taking their time. |
