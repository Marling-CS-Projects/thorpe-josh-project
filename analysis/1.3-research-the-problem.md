<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/enterthegungeongameplay.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

_Enter the Gungeon_ is a bullet hell roguelike game developed by Dodge Roll. In the game players take on the role of one of several characters called Gungeoneers, each with their own unique abilities and starting weapons. Players explore a procedurally generated dungeon known as the Gungeon with the goal of finding a powerful gun that can "_kill the past_". The Gungeon is filled with a variety of enemies which players must use their weapons to defeat while dodging many enemy projectiles coming their way.  If the player dies, they lose all items and guns obtained on a playthrough and must start again at the first floor.

### Controls

Enter the Gungeon uses WASD movement.

| Feature                       | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Permadeath                    | I will include permadeath in my game because it adds a sense of danger which you don't otherwise have. It forces players to learn the mechanics and helps the game to still feel dangerous even to someone who has played it for a while.      |
| Different starting characters | Including different characters for players to play allows them to experiment with different playstyles and ultimately play how they like.                                                                                                      |
| Many projectiles              | Enter the Gungeon is a bullet hell rougelike game. The term "_bullet hell_" refers to a sub-genre of shooters whose main gameplay focus is dodging seemingly endless waves of colored bullets. I'd like to include aspects of this in my game. |
| AI enemies                    | Like Enter the Gungeon, the enemies in my game will be controlled by an AI which can move around and shoot at the player. It's important that they attack in somewhat predictable patterns so as to not fustrate the player.                   |
| Unique weapons                | It's important for each weapon to feel unique and different because his keeps the game exciting and engaging. In order to do this each weapon needs to have unique statistics and characteristics.                                             |

| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dodge roll   | In Enter the Gungeon the dodge roll is used to dodge through enemy projectiles and jump over crevices. In my game there will not be any holes in the ground and I want players to focus on avoiding projectiles rather than running through them.        |
| Blanks       | In Enter the Gungeon, blanks are used to clear the entire area of gunfire for a moment and damage and push away  enemies.  This would not be appropriate for my game because the enemies will not be strong enough to the point where this is necessary. |
| 200+ weapons | I don't want to confuse the player by having a huge amount of different weapons. However there needs to be enough distinct weapons to provide diversity and interest.                                                                                    |

## Soul Knight

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/soulknightgameplay.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

_Soul Knight_ is a top-down rougelike dungeon crawler developed by ChillyRoom where the ultimate goal is to reach the end of the dungeon. Players achieve this by using weapons which can be found or bought throughout the dungeon to deafeat enemies in each room and eventually bosses too. Players start off with a character of their choice and collect crafting materials and gems as they go which can be used in the lobby outside the dungeon to unlock new starting characters and starting weapons.

### Controls

Like most mobile games Soul Knight uses touchscreen controls. A joystick controls movement and there are various buttons to change weapon, fire the weapon and activate skills.

In Soul Knight the player's character automatically aims weapons towards the nearest enemy. This means that players have limited control over aiming but it makes the game simpler to learn and play.

| Feature            | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple art style   | A simple art style works well in Soul Knight and I think it will be effective in my game too. It helps players to easily distinguish important elements and will make it easier when there are lots o fprojectiles flying around. |
| Destructible cover | Destructible cover provides obstacles which players can hide behind but destroy to shoot through. It helps the game feel more immersive and forces the player to make decisions as to whether they want to destroy or use it.     |
| Chests             | In Soul Knight some rooms are special chest rooms where players can find new weapons somewhat frequently. I want to include something similar so that players do not get bored from using the same weapon for a long time.        |
| Melee weapons      | Melee weapons add diversity to Soul Knight and I would like to include them in mine to provide some contrast to using guns and make the game have a wider feel.                                                                   |

| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reviving     | By not introducing a revive system, dying feels more consequential as it causes the player to start over. Therefore the game will feel more exciting as the player may die at any moment.                                                                                                |
| Auto aim     | Being a mobile game, it makes sense for Soul Knight to simplify the aiming system in order to make the controls easier. However my game will be for PC so controls will not be an issue. I want players to aim for themselves as it will serve as a source of challenge within the game. |
| Skills       | In Soul Knight, each character has a unique skill which can be used with a cooldown. I am not going to include this because my game will not have that many characters and adding unique skills may be time consuming to implement, detracting from other aspects of the game.           |
| Mounts/mechs | Mounts and mechs allow the player to quickly move around the map to reach enemies quickly. This will not be necessary for my game because the map will be small enough so that the player will not have to travel far for each objective.                                                |
