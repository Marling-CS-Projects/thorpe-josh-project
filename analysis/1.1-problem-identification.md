# 1.1 Problem Identification



82% of global consumers played video game content during the height of the COVID 19 pandemic lockdowns. Video gaming and esports helped to create a much-needed distraction for many consumers during a difficult time. [(“3, 2, 1 Go! Video Gaming is at an All-Time High During COVID-19,” 2020)](../reference-list.md#problem-identification) During the COVID 19 pandemic, the global time spent video gaming increased by 39%. [(Clement, 2021)](../reference-list.md#problem-identification) The figure below illustrates this sharp increase.

9 out of 10 gamers say that they are playing as much as they did during the pandemic's peak or more. [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](../reference-list.md#problem-identification) ([https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15554120211017036](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15554120211017036))

Video games have become more poplular than ever. In 2020 a survey of U.S adults showed 64% play video games - that's more than 214 million people in the U.S who play video games one hour or more per week. Video games have become a natural part of people's lives with 75% of U.S households with at least one gamer.  [(Fitzgerald, 2020)](../reference-list.md#problem-identification)

This popularity is reflected in retail success. In 2021 alone, the Global “Games Market” had a whopping $180bn in revenue, making gaming bigger than Hollywood and the music industry combined. [(Patience, 2022)](../reference-list.md#problem-identification) The gaming industry is expected to keep growing and is forcast to reach $321 billion by 2026.

Playing video games has also been proven to provide clear cognitive benefits. A study of nearly 2,000 children ages 9-10 found that those who reported playing video games for three hours per day or more performed better on cognitive skills tests involving impulse control and working memory compared to children who had never played video games. [(“Video gaming may be associated with better cognitive performance in children,” 2022)](../reference-list.md#problem-identification) Furthermore, action games in particular have been shown to improve players perceptual decision making [(Green et al., 2010)](../reference-list.md#problem-identification) and their ability to improve visually presented information.
