## Growing Success of the Gaming Industry

Video games have become more popular than ever. In 2020 a survey of U.S adults showed 64% play video games - that's more than 214 million people in the U.S who play video games one hour or more per week. Video games have become a natural part of people's lives with 75% of U.S households with at least one gamer.  [(Fitzgerald, 2020)](reference-list.md#problem-identification)

This popularity is reflected in retail success. In 2021 alone, the Global “Games Market” had a whopping $180bn in revenue, making gaming bigger than Hollywood and the music industry combined. [(Patience, 2022)](reference-list.md#problem-identification) The gaming industry is expected to keep growing and is forecast to reach $321 billion by 2026.

## The Impact of Lockdowns on Video Games

During the pandemic, many people began playing video games more frequently. The increase in video game usage during the pandemic is likely due to people spending more time at home. Many individuals turned to video games to avoid boredom, to socialise, or as a way to escape the stresses of the real world. [(Farokhmanesh, 2021)](reference-list.md#problem-identification) A whopping 82% of global consumers played video game content during the height of COVID-19 lockdowns. [(Nielsen, 2020)](reference-list.md#problem-identification)

Overall, the global time spent on video gaming increased by 39% during the COVID-19 pandemic. [(Clement, 2021)](reference-list.md#problem-identification) This spike in video game consumption looks to have been sustained after the pandemic, with 9 out of 10 gamers playing the same amount or more than during the pandemic's peak. [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](reference-list.md#problem-identification)&#x20;

A study [(Barr and Copeland-Stewart, 2021)](reference-list.md#problem-identification) surveying 781 gamers during the pandemic found that time spent on video gaming increased for 71% of respondents.

The above graphs show respondents’ gameplay habits before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, demonstrating a clear increase in the frequency of play. For example, 10.5% of respondents reported playing video games several times a day prior to the pandemic, which increases to 40% during the pandemic. Similarly, 5.4% of respondents stated they rarely played games before the outbreak, a figure that drops to just 0.4% after the outbreak.

## Cognitive Benefits of Video Games

Various studies have shown that cognitive skills such as perception, attentional control, and decision-making improve when subjects are trained with video games. [(Reynaldo et al., 2021)](reference-list.md#problem-identification)

A study of nearly 2,000 children ages 9-10 found that those who reported playing video games for three hours per day or more performed better on cognitive skills tests involving impulse control and working memory compared to children who had never played video games. [(National Institutes of Health, 2022)](reference-list.md#problem-identification) Furthermore, action games in particular have been shown to improve players' perceptual decision-making [(Green et al., 2010)](reference-list.md#problem-identification) and their ability to improve visually presented information.
