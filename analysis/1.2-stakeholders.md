# 1.2 Stakeholders

The average video game consumer is older than most people realise. Three quarters of video game players are over the age of 18 and the average age is 33. [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](../reference-list.md#stakeholders)

Playing video games has also been proven to provide clear cognative benefits. A study of nearly 2,000 children ages 9-10 found that those who reported playing video games for three hours per day or more performed better on cognitive skills tests involving impulse control and working memory compared to children who had never played video games. [(“Video gaming may be associated with better cognitive performance in children,” 2022)](../reference-list.md#stakeholders) Furthermore, action games in particular have been shown to improve players perceptual decision making [(Green et al., 2010)](../reference-list.md#stakeholders) and their ability to improve visually presented information. [(Sungur and Boduroglu, 2012)](../reference-list.md#stakeholders) More and more these benefits are beginning to be recognised by consumers. 97% of all Americans now see the benefits of playing video games, with 91% agreeing that video games provide mental stimulation and 89% believing that they provide stress relief.
