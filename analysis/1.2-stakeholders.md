# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Who is the average gamer?

There are over 3 billion active video gamers across the globe. [(Howarth, 2022)](reference-list.md#stakeholders) However, he media portrays video game players as stereotypically male and young. [(Williams et al., 2008)](reference-list.md#stakeholders) The average gamer is very different. Three quarters of video game players are over the age of 18 and the average age is 33. [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](reference-list.md#stakeholders) 48% of people who play video games identify as female and 29% of game players are people of color. [(Rousseau, 2022)](reference-list.md#stakeholders) To maximize the potential audience for a video game, it's crucial to consider the diversity of the consumer base to create a product that appeals to a wide range of potential customers.

## What is the motivation to play video games?

A survey conducted in 2019 assessed the "gamer motivation" of over 400,000 gamers. The survey found that for gamers over the age of 36, the most common primary motivations for playing video games tend to be _fantasy_ and _completion_, while the least common are _excitement_ and _challenge_. Gamers who score highly for the _fantasy_ motivation enjoy being immersed in the game world and lore. Meanwhile, gamers scoring highly for the _completion_ motivation are driven by quantifiable rewards which demonstrate clear progress. [(Yee, 2019)](reference-list.md#stakeholders)

It is also important to note that destruction and strategy also score highly. <a href="reference-list.md#stakeholders">(Yee, 2019)</a></p></figcaption></figure>

The _completion_ motivation is not only popular amongst older gamers but also across all age ranges and irrespective of sex. [(Yee, 2019)](reference-list.md#stakeholders) Therefore, it is important for games to include completionist features in order to satisfy a wide range of consumers. This is could be included in the form of unlockable perks or achievements for example.&#x20;

People may also play video games as a way to improve their mental well-being. 91% of Americans agree that video games provide mental stimulation and 89% say that they relieve stress. [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](reference-list.md#stakeholders)

## PEGI Ratings

The Pan-European Game Information (PEGI) age rating system was established to help European parents make informed decisions on buying computer games. The age rating on each video game confirms game content is appropriate for players of certain ages. PEGI considers the age suitability of a game, not the level of difficulty. [(PEGI, 2023a)](reference-list.md#stakeholders)

To be assigned a PEGI rating, video game publishers first complete a detailed questionnaire about the content of the product and the presence of any material which may not be appropriate for all ages. Based on these responses, PEGI's rating system automatically determines a provisional age rating with content descriptors. Then the PEGI administrators review the game content which is received from the publisher and either approve or alter the provisional age rating. [(PEGI, 2023b)](reference-list.md#stakeholders)

I believe that a PEGI 12 rating is most suitable for my game and will appeal to both teenagers and adults. My game will include violence towards fantasy and humanoid characters. This is within the limits for a PEGI 12 game, as indicated by the rating description: "_Video games that show violence of a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy characters or non-realistic violence towards human-like characters would fall in this age category. Sexual innuendo or sexual posturing can be present, while any bad language in this category must be mild."_ [(PEGI, 2023c](reference-list.md#stakeholders))
