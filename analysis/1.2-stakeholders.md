# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Who is the average gamer?

The average video game consumer is older than most people realise. Three quarters of video game players are over the age of 18 and the average age is 33. [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](../reference-list.md#stakeholders)&#x20;

## What's the motivation to play video games?

A survey conducted in 2019 assessed the "gamer motivation" of over 400,000 gamers. The survey found that for gamers over the age of 36, the most common primary motivations for playing video games tend to be _fantasy_ and _completion_, while the least common are _excitement_ and _challenge_. Gamers who score highly for the _fantasy_ motivation enjoy being immersed in the game world and lore. Meanwhile gamers scoring highly for the _completion_ motivation are driven by quantifiable rewards which demonstrate clear progress. [(Yee, 2019)](../reference-list.md#stakeholders)

The _completion_ motivation is not only popular amongst older gamers, but also across all age ranges and irrespective of sex. Therefore it is important for games to include completionist features in order to satisfy a wide range of consumers. This is could be included in the form of unlockable perks or achievements for example. [(Yee, 2019)](../reference-list.md#stakeholders)
