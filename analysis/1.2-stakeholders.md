# 1.2 Stakeholders

The average video game consumer is older than most people realise. Three quarters of video game players are over the age of 18 - the average age being 33. [(Entertainment Software Association, 2022)](../reference-list.md#stakeholders)

Playing video games has also been proven to provide clear cognative benefits. A study of nearly 2,000 children ages 9-10 found that those who reported playing video games for three hours per day or more performed better on cognitive skills tests involving impulse control and working memory compared to children who had never played video games. [(“Video gaming may be associated with better cognitive performance in children,” 2022)](../reference-list.md#stakeholders) Furthermore, action games in particular have been shown to improve players perceptual decision making [(Green et al., 2010)](../reference-list.md#stakeholders) and their ability to improve visually presented information.
