### Controls

<table><thead><tr><th width="115">Criterion</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>When was it achieved</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>The player can move the character using the WASD keys. </td><td>This movement system is simple and easy to use.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1.md">Cycle 1</a></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>The player can 'dash' using the right mouse button, which increases movement speed for a few seconds.</td><td>This provides a way for players to attempt to quickly get out of a tricky situation and allows for more interesting movements.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1.md">Cycle 1</a></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>The weapon aims in the direction of the mouse cursor and clicking will attack in that direction.</td><td>This allows the player to aim, and the weapon should attack in the direction that the player is aiming.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-1.md">Cycle 2</a></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>When near a chest or purchasable item, pressing E will carry out the action.</td><td>E is near the movement keys which makes it easier to interact with objects while moving.</td><td>Not achieved</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>The number keys can be used to switch the active weapon (if the player has picked up enough wepaons).</td><td>Being able to use multiple weapons makes the game feel more diverse and exciting.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-10.md">Cycle 10</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Criterion 1 - Achieved

WASD movement was one of the first features I added in Cycle 1. I made each character have a different movement speed later in Cycle 11 but WASD movement has otherwise remained largely the same.

#### Criterion 2 - Achieved

Dashing was another feature which has been in the game since Cycle 1. In Cycle 11, I changed dashing so that the statistics are different for each playable character and in Cycle 15 I added a dash cooldown bar so it is clear for players when they can dash again.

### Map

<table><thead><tr><th width="113">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>When was it achieved</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6</td><td>There are 3 floors which the player has to fight.</td><td>Each floor acts as a seperate level. Having 3 levels allows me to increases the difficulty as you progress, without the game feeling too long.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-6.md">Cycle 7</a></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td> A floor is made up of a series of connected rooms.</td><td>Each room poses a seperate challenge in a level. Combat in these rooms will pose as the main source of gameplay.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-6.md">Cycle 7</a></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Each floor is generated when the previous one is defeated.</td><td>By only generating a new floor when its needed, this reduces the computational power required.</td><td>Not achieved</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Floors are generated differently each time from a selection of premade rooms.</td><td>This ensures that the game doesn't feel repetitive from playing through the same floor layout over and over.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-6.md">Cycle 7</a></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Only one room is shown on the screen at a time. When the player touches a door the next room is shown.</td><td>Showing all the map at once would make it difficult to see what was going on. Also all the enemies present at once could be an issue computationally.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-2.md">Cycle 3</a> &#x26; <a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-12.md">Cycle 12</a></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>The first room on floors 2 and 3 is a peaceful shop room where players can spend their currency to buy items.</td><td>This allows players to prepare for the floor ahead during a moment of relative calm after having beaten the previous floor.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-13.md">Cycle 13</a></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>There is one chest room in a floor which awards the player with a weapon and some coins when they open it.</td><td>This provides the player with opportunities to unlock new and exciting weapons, even if they don't have enough coins to buy one in the shop.</td><td>Not achieved</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Traps and destructable boxes will be scattered throughout the rooms.</td><td>They will provide some extra hazards for players to content with and make rooms more interesting.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-2.md">Cycle 3</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Enemies

<table><thead><tr><th width="114">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>14</td><td>Different enemies will appear on different floors, becoming increasingly more powerful as the player progresses.</td><td>This means the difficulty will increase the further the player gets, providing a necessary amount of challenge.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-12.md">Cycle 12</a></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Enemies attack the player in predictable patterns by waiting a couple of seconds before attacking and moving.</td><td>This allows players to predict and learn enemy movement as they play, adding a layer of skill which comes with experience.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-8.md">Cycle 8b</a></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>There is a boss at the end of each floor which has lots of health. Boss attacks deal more damage than enemies and are hard to avoid.</td><td>Bosses will provide a challenge which players need to beat at the end of a floor. This will reward the player with a great sense of achievement having beaten a level.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-14.md">Cycle 14</a></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Boss enemies have a chance to spawn its minions after shooting.</td><td>This will make bosses more challenging and exciting.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-14.md">Cycle 14</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Mechanics

<table><thead><tr><th width="114">Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th>Justification</th><th>When was it achieved</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>18</td><td>A collision system which prevents players or enemies from walking through barriers.</td><td>A collision system is important to ensure that players don't leave the bounds of the map or break logic by phasing through obstacles.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-2.md">Cycle 3</a></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Bullet collision detects when a bullet has hit an entity and applies the damage to its health. Then the bullet disappears.</td><td>Bullets from different weapons will deal different amounts of damage to enemies and bulllets should disappear on impact.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-9.md">Cycle 9</a></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>If the health of an enemy reaches 0 then it disappears.</td><td>This ensures dead enemies do not fill the screen and make it hard to see what's going on.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-8.md">Cycle 8b</a></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>Coins are dropped from enemies and chests.</td><td>Players will have a reliable source of currency with they can use at a shop.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-9.md">Cycle 9</a></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Permanent power ups increase the player's stats until the end of the run. +1 attack, +1 speed, -0.1 reload etc</td><td>Powerups will help players if they are struggling with enemies and also provide a sense of progression through a run.</td><td>Not achieved</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Temporary power ups will boost the player but only for a short duration (eg 30-60 seconds).</td><td>Temporary boosts will help players for a short period and give them a taste of the permanent powerups.</td><td>Not achieved</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>Touching an active trap deals damage to the player.</td><td>Traps will be an extra challange the player has to contend with.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-4.md">Cycle 5</a></td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Consuming health items will restore hp.</td><td>Allowing players to restore health points means that they won't feel too fustrated taking damage so will enjoy the game more.</td><td><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-13.md">Cycle 13</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### UI

<table><thead><tr><th width="116">Ref.
