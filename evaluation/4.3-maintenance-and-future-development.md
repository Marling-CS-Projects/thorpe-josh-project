# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of the Project

* Lack of enemy variety - Different enemy types are too similar and there is not much to differentiate between them other than more health and damage.
* Basic shop layout - Due to time constraints I was not able to implement my initial plan for the shop into the game and instead it has a more basic setup.
* No powerups - Powerups are another feature which I would have liked to include if I had more time
* Not enough levels - While the levels on each floor feel random, every so often the generation will put the same level twice and sometimes you can recognise a level you have played before.
* Limited graphics - My game's visuals are somewhat basic as there are no animations or particle effects.

## Maintenance

If I decided to keep the game fundamentally the same as it is now, then I would only need to implement short-term changes and fixes to address any tweaks which need to be made. The current limitations of the project would not need to be expanded or changed and after resolving any outstanding bugs, the game would be ready for final release. This could continue to be done by me as the game would not be expanding in a substantial way, and I have used inline comments to make sure that I can understand how the code works in the future.

When considering the game's potential for growth, a lot of new features could be added. However, first I would still need to implement the short-term changes to ensure that my game has a solid foundation for future development cycles. Then I would review the current limitations of my project to decide the objectives of the upcoming cycles. As my project grows, it is really important that I maintain good code readability and use comments to effectively explain each part so that it can easily be worked on in the future. Additionally, at some point, it may become beneficial to bring others in to assist in developing the game and create a team to work collaboratively - resolving bugs and implementing new features.

## Future Development

### Short Term Plan

#### Game balancing

Feedback from my usability testing found that some users thought that some weapons were not properly balanced and that the game may be too difficult. While the majority of users thought that the balance of the game was just right, the response to the question asking how difficult the game is was weighted more to the harder side, as shown below. Feedback told me that the increase in difficulty at floor 3 is too high. To fix this I could tone down some of the statistics for enemies 4, 5 and 6 and I could change some of the spawn locations on floor 3 so that enemies start further away from the player.

Another thing contributing to the balancing issue is bosses spawning minions in boss fights. The current random chance system means that sometimes a boss may spawn no minions and it is too easy, or a boss could spawn loads of minions and it is way too hard. To fix this I could change the % chance of spawning to a fixed spawning system where a boss will always spawn minions after shooting a certain number of times. This change would make boss fights more consistent and make boss fights fairer for players.

I received lots of feedback regarding the weapons and pricing in the shop not being properly balanced. The price of each weapon in the shop does not accurately correspond to how good each weapon is. The more expensive weapons (ironclad rifle and clockwork revolver) are too weak while one of the cheaper weapons (the brass spraygun) is too strong. To address this I would reduce the damage and rate of fire of the spraygun while increasing the rate of fire of the ironclad rifle and increasing the accuracy and damage of the clockwork revolver. The boomstick weapon is mostly balanced but I would still increase the number of projectiles it fires, while reducing the damage per projectile, to keep it roughly the same but making it feel more shotgun-like. Below are some examples of user feedback from my usability testing about balancing weapons.

#### Unclear introduction level

Feedback from my usability testing suggested that the introduction level could benefit from being made clearer. As explored in my [Evaluation of Usability Features](4.2-evaluation-of-usability-features.md), some users may not have known how to interact with the shopkeeper and hence never seen the introduction message. To address this I could add a small '!' or '?' symbol above the shopkeeper's head, or a small message saying 'touch to interact'. This would make it clear to the players what they need to do.

I could also make the introduction level clearer by adding a bit more detail to the shopkeeper's message. I would add a sentence explaining more about the different weapons and another sentence saying to proceed through the door to the next level.

### Long-Term Addressing Limitations

#### Lack of enemy variety

#### Basic shop layout

#### No powerups

#### Not enough levels

#### Limited graphics
