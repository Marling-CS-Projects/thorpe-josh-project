# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                       | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create bosses as clear objectives to determine the end of a floor | Success      |
| 2           | Make the overall objective and path of the game clear             | Success      |

### Feature 1

I added boss fights in[ Cycle 14](../design-and-development/cycle-1-14.md) which the player must fight at the end of each floor before they can progress to the shop level. These serve as milestones in the game and a measurable form of progress that players can share with others which forms a social aspect of my game. When people were testing my game for my usability testing, I received a lot of verbal feedback such as "I made it quite far but died to the second boss" or "I beat the first boss, now I just need to kill the second". This suggests that the bosses in my game are good milestones and players get a sense of achievement when beating one. Also, I was very pleased that people liked playing my game and wanted to talk about it!

### Feature 2

I took many steps to make the overall objective of the game clear. There is an introduction level which I added in Cycle 13 where the shopkeeper will briefly explain that the goal of the game is to defeat the final boss. Also, if the player dies the loss screen displays the floor the player reached and the total number of floors (three) so the player knows how close they were. However, even if I didn't include these features, the objective of the game would still be somewhat clear because after each level you can only move forward to the next room so it is obvious that you need to get as far as possible.

Feedback from my usability testing was very positive. All of the 18 responses to the question "Is the objective of the game clear?" responded with 'Yes'. This shows that the objective and path through my game were well implemented and my game provides an effective solution with clear objectives.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                                            | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a menu system that is quick and easy to navigate through                                                        | Success      |
| 2           | Create a control system that is simple and not too complicated, while still allowinf the player to do multiple actions | Success      |

### Feature 1

I first added the menu and character selection system in Cycle 11 but I then improved it dramatically in Cycle 15 and Cycle 18 because it is very important that the menu system provides an optimal experience. I wanted to make the menus and character selection in my game as pleasant and easy as possible because you must interact with it at the start of every game and it is also going to be the first impression a player has of my game. I've made sure that the design is nice to look at and it is clear where you must click to do each action.

The feedback from my usability testing agreed. When asked the question "How easy are the menus to navigate?" 94% of respondents chose 1 on a scale of 1 to 5. This shows that the menu system in my game was clearly efficient and well-designed.

### Feature 2

The first player controls were added in the early cycles of my development: the movement controls in Cycle 1 and the aiming and shooting controls in Cycle 2. Later, weapon switching was added in Cycle 10 and pause menu functionality in Cycle 17. My goal was to add all of the necessary controls while keeping it simple. That's why I chose WASD movement and the mouse to aim and shoot since these controls feature a lot in other games. Also, switching items/tools is quite commonly done with the number keys in other games too. This means that I chose the tried-and-tested simplest way of implementing these features into my game.

The feedback for my usability testing was positive. When asked the question "How easy are the controls to use?" 17 of the 18 respondents chose either a 1 or 2 on a scale from 1 to 5. This shows that my controls were sufficiently simple and not too complicated. Perhaps a reason why more people didn't choose a 1 was because they did not read the how to play menu before playing. I have an idea to increase usability which I will discuss in [Maintenance and Future Development](4.3-maintenance-and-future-development.md).

## Engaging

| 1           | Ensure that players can play with different weapons              | Success      |
| 2           | Randomise floor generation so the game feels different each time | Success      |
| 3           | Incorporate a style of game art that suits the game              | Success      |

### Feature 1

I've included multiple different weapons in my game which the player can use to keep the gameplay fresh and engaging. I added the gear gun, brass spraygun and boomstick in Cycle 10 and the ironclad carbine and clockwork revolver in Cycle 13.
